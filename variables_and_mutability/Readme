In This chapter of "The Rust Programming Language" book it gives the summary of variables and its mutability
-> Varibales are by defualt immutable it means you can not change the value of the variable on the other part
of the code once you bound the value
-> If you want to make the variable mutable then use 'mut' before the variable name like:
let mut x =6;

Difference between immutable variable and constants
-> Immutable varibale's behaviour sounds same as the Constants but there is a difference between them 

-> Constants can be declared with the 'const' keyword before the variable name .like
const y:u32=6; //the type of the value must be annotated,in this case u32 is the type value

->The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,
 not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.
