and also the commands of cargo like:
1.cargo build -> this command compile and create the binary file by creating the target/debug directory
2.cargo run -> this command first check the changes in the source code if there got some change
then it will compile the src code and then display the output on the terminal
3.cargo check -> this command check our code and make sure it's compile but not produce binary/exe
4.cargo build --release -> this command create the exe file with optimization when our project
